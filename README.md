# Visual-Computing-Intro
This project is an introduction to visual computing using WebGL and Three.js. It demonstrates basic 3D graphics programming concepts, including camera controls, object transformations, lighting, and event handling. The project is interactive, allowing users to manipulate the 3D objects and camera within the scene.

## Features
- 3D Object Manipulation: Includes basic shapes (like cubes) and more complex 3D models.
- Camera Controls: Interactive camera controls to view objects from different angles.
- Render Modes: Options to view objects in different render modes such as wireframe, vertices, etc.
- Lighting and Shadows: Basic implementation of lighting and shadows for a more realistic scene.
- Event Handling: Keyboard event handling for interactive object and camera manipulation.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open index.html in a web browser that supports WebGL (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3. Use the keyboard controls as described below to interact with the scene.

## Controls
- Object Rotation: Press 1, 2, or 3 to rotate the object along the X, Y, or Z axis, respectively.
- Camera Movement: Use the arrow keys for camera movement and Page Up/Page Down for forward/backward movement.
- Change Render Modes: Press f, e, v to toggle between face, edge, and vertex render modes.
- Load 3D Model: Press i to load a 3D bunny model.
- Camera Auto-Rotation: Press d to start auto-rotation, c to stop, and o to reset.
- Object Textures: Press t to apply new textures to the cube, g to reset.
- Additional Controls: Use s to stop rotation, p to reset rotation.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- JavaScript
- WebGL
- Three.js
